<h1>Indu Gaddamadugu</h1>
<p>Hi my name is Indu! I like to go on fun food adventures with my friends. I also enjoy coding, photography, and powerlifting. I aspire to become a computer scientist and a professional photographer when I grow up and I hope to compete in a powerlifting competition within the next year.</p>
<p>Currently I am learning about circuits. So far I have learnt what short and open circuits are and why they can be an issue. I also learned how to creat a working parallel circuit to make an LED light light up and what a series in circuitry is.</p>
